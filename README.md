# Binary-Search-Text-Analysis
‚≠êÔ∏è This project implements recursive binary search for efficient text analysis. 
‚ú® The StringVector class stores words in both sorted and unsorted vectors, enabling comparisons between binary and linear search methods. 
üí° It reads through large text files to determine the number of unique words, showcasing the performance improvements of binary search over linear search. 
‚ö°Ô∏è Test cases using classic books like Dracula, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and War and Peace demonstrate the runtime efficiency, especially on larger datasets.
